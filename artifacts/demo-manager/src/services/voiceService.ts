/**
 * voiceService.ts — CS2 voice mode selection and command generation.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   "all"     → voice_enable 1; tv_listen_voice_indices -1; tv_listen_voice_indices_h -1
 *   "none"    → voice_enable 0
 *   "team_t"  → tv_listen_voice_indices <bitmask of Terrorist slots>
 *   "team_ct" → tv_listen_voice_indices <bitmask of Counter-Terrorist slots>
 *
 * Team identification uses ONLY demo data (m_iTeamNum from entity observer):
 *   teamNum === 2 → Terrorist
 *   teamNum === 3 → Counter-Terrorist
 *
 * No FACEIT player data is used for voice mapping or team splitting.
 * XUID (m_steamID) and name (m_iszPlayerName) come exclusively from the demo.
 *
 * PARTIAL MATCHING:
 *   For team_t / team_ct, a command is generated as long as at least ONE player
 *   in that team has a known entityId. Missing slots are absent from the bitmask
 *   and the caller shows a warning. Only when ZERO slots are known is null returned.
 *
 * Player slot numbers (entityId) come from the source2-demo entity observer
 * (entity.index() IS the voice_mute slot). The Rust parser falls back to the
 * CDemoStringTables "userinfo" table only when the entity observer returns
 * no players. Both paths populate TauriDemoPlayer.entityId.
 *
 * tv_listen_voice_indices  — signed 32-bit bitmask for slots 0–31
 * tv_listen_voice_indices_h — signed 32-bit bitmask for slots 32–63 (always 0 in CS2)
